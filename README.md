## Project Overview
I've been given the following tasks to complete by the Colorado Board of Elections regarding the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the total number of votes from each county.
7. Calcualte the precentage of votes cast from each county and determine which one had the largest turnout.

## Challenge Overview
The starter code that I was provided with was able to retrieve all of the election data for each of the candidates, analyze that data, and return its results to the command line.  I was tasked with producing similar code that could execute those tasks for the county data.
